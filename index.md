### Hello there!üëã
I‚Äôm Hong Kang (Â∫∑ÂÆè in chinese) a dedicated **M.Phil student** majoring in **Computer and Information Engineering** at the School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (**CUHKSZ**). My academic journey is anchored at the [<span style="color:olive">Human-Crypto Society Laboratory</span>](https://hcslab.cuhk.edu.cn/) (**HCSLab**), where I'm privileged to be under the expert guidance of [<span style="color:olive">Prof. Wei Cai</span>](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/caiwei/).

Before the M.Phil studies, I proudly earned a **B.Eng** Degree in **Electronic Information Engineering** from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (**UESTC**) and a joint B.Eng Degree (with **First Class Honors**) from the University of Glasgow (**UofG**) in 2021. During this period, I had the honor of being supervised by [<span style="color:olive">Prof. Chunbo Luo</span>](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/staff/cl535?sm=cl535#) and [<span style="color:olive">Prof. Lei Zhang</span>](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/engineering/staff/leizhang/).

My research passion lies at the intersection of **Blockchain/Web3**, **Incentive Mechanism Design**, **Edge Intelligence**, and **Security/Privacy**. As I delve deeper into these fields, I'm keenly exploring opportunities to further my studies with a **Ph.D.** program for the **Spring/Fall 2024**.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to potentially collaborating or crossing academic paths in the near future.
